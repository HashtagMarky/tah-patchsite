# Adding your own hack

## The Necessities
### Hack Page
Duplicate the `hacks/template` folder. Rename it the name of your hack.
### Logo
To that folder, add a high resolution logo for your hack, named `logo.png`.
### Patches & Info
Create a subfolder called `patches` and add your own. Edit the `patches.info` file with the relevant info.
### Homepage
Add the hack to the homepage.

## Optional Extras
### Hack Page Background
Within your hacks folder, you can edit the color defined in `color.css` to change the hack page's background color.
### Hack Info
If you would like to add more info to your Hack Page, create an `info.md` file within your folder, and include whatever you would like.
### Other Images
Other Images can be used on your Hack Page, but editting the HTML will be needed. (A maintainer may be able to help)
